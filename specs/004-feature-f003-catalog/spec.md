# Feature Specification: F003 ‚Äì Catalog Explorer UI

**Feature Branch**: `004-feature-f003-catalog`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Feature: F003 ‚Äì Catalog Explorer UI

Goal:
A search-first web app to discover Collections, Types, Fields, Queries, Services, and their relationships, with deep links to source lines, drift indicators, and query helpers.

Users:
Backend devs & SREs.

Screens (MVP):
1) Global Search ‚Äì instant, federated results (kinds grouped) + facets (repo, service, operation, changed_since).
2) Collection Detail ‚Äì Schema tab (declared vs observed with % presence and drift badges), Types, Queries (with code snippets), Relationships (mini graph).
3) Type Detail ‚Äì class header, fields/attrs table, collections used, usages, diff summary (between SHAs).
4) Graph View ‚Äì Cytoscape force graph, filters by edgeKinds and depth, click-through to details.
5) Query Helper ‚Äì for a selected type/field path, generate Mongo shell and Builders<T> examples.

Constraints:
- Next.js (TypeScript, App Router), Tailwind, shadcn/ui, SWR
- Monaco Editor for code snippets
- Cytoscape.js for graphs
- Keyboard navigation; copy-as buttons; Git deep links

Acceptance:
- Search keystroke-to-result <300ms P50 (dev data, cached)
- Collection and Type pages render in <400ms P50 after cache warm
- Copy-as buttons provide valid examples for Mongo shell and C# Builders<T>"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-19
- Q: Authentication & Authorization Model ‚Üí A: No authentication required (open access)
- Q: Concurrent User Scale ‚Üí A: 10-50 concurrent users
- Q: Error Handling for Broken Source Links ‚Üí A: Redirect to repository root
- Q: Data Volume Scale Assumptions ‚Üí A: Up to 10,000 total
- Q: Search Result Limits ‚Üí A: Show all results with pagination

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a backend developer or SRE, I want to quickly discover and understand the structure of Collections, Types, Fields, Queries, and Services in my codebase, so that I can efficiently navigate relationships, identify drift between declared and observed schemas, and generate appropriate queries for my work.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a backend developer looking for a specific collection, **When** I type in the global search, **Then** I see instant federated results grouped by kind (Collections, Types, Fields, Queries, Services) with relevant facets
2. **Given** I want to understand a collection's schema, **When** I navigate to a Collection Detail page, **Then** I see declared vs observed schema with presence percentages and drift indicators
3. **Given** I need to understand how a type is used, **When** I view a Type Detail page, **Then** I see the class structure, field attributes, collections that use it, and usage patterns
4. **Given** I want to visualize relationships, **When** I open the Graph View, **Then** I see an interactive force graph with filters for edge types and depth
5. **Given** I need to write queries for a specific type/field, **When** I use the Query Helper, **Then** I get valid examples for Mongo shell and C# Builders<T>

### Edge Cases
- What happens when search returns no results?
- How does the system handle large codebases with up to 10,000 entities?
- What occurs when drift indicators show significant schema differences?
- When source code links are broken or unavailable, the system redirects to repository root

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide instant global search across Collections, Types, Fields, Queries, and Services with federated results grouped by kind and pagination for all results
- **FR-002**: System MUST display search results with facets for repository, service, operation, and changed_since filters
- **FR-003**: System MUST show Collection Detail pages with schema comparison (declared vs observed), presence percentages, and drift badges
- **FR-004**: System MUST display Type Detail pages with class headers, field/attribute tables, collection usage, and diff summaries between SHAs
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide Graph View with interactive force graph visualization, edge type filters, and depth controls
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate Query Helper examples for Mongo shell and C# Builders<T> based on selected type/field paths
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide deep links to source code lines for all entities
- **FR-008**: System MUST support keyboard navigation throughout the interface
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide copy-as functionality for generated code examples
- **FR-010**: System MUST render search results within 300ms P50 for cached development data
- **FR-011**: System MUST render Collection and Type detail pages within 400ms P50 after cache warm-up
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide valid, executable examples for Mongo shell and C# Builders<T> through copy-as buttons

- **FR-013**: System MUST redirect to repository root when source code links are broken or unavailable
- **FR-014**: System MUST support 10-50 concurrent users without performance degradation
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide open access without authentication requirements

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST handle up to 10,000 total entities (Collections, Types, Fields, Queries, Services) without performance degradation
- **NFR-002**: System MUST support 10-50 concurrent users with search response times under 300ms P50
- **NFR-003**: System MUST render Collection and Type detail pages within 400ms P50 after cache warm-up
- **NFR-004**: System MUST provide open access without authentication or authorization requirements

### Key Entities
- **Collection**: Represents a data collection with declared schema, observed schema, presence metrics, and drift indicators
- **Type**: Represents a code type/class with fields, attributes, usage across collections, and version history
- **Field**: Represents individual properties/attributes within types with metadata and usage patterns
- **Query**: Represents database query operations with code snippets and relationship to collections/types
- **Service**: Represents service definitions with their relationships to collections and types
- **Relationship**: Represents connections between entities (collections to types, types to fields, etc.) with edge types and metadata
