# Research: F003 â€“ Catalog Explorer UI

**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Feature**: Catalog Explorer UI  
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Technology Decisions

## Technology Stack Research

### Next.js 14+ App Router
**Decision**: Use Next.js 14+ with App Router for the frontend application  
**Rationale**: 
- App Router provides better performance with Server Components and streaming
- Built-in routing, API routes, and optimization features
- Excellent TypeScript support and developer experience
- Strong ecosystem and community support
- Fits constitution requirement for Next.js (TypeScript) for UI components

**Alternatives considered**:
- React with Vite: Less integrated routing and optimization features
- Vue.js: Not aligned with constitution requirements
- SvelteKit: Smaller ecosystem, not in constitution

### State Management & Data Fetching
**Decision**: Use SWR for client-side data fetching with server actions  
**Rationale**:
- SWR provides excellent caching, revalidation, and error handling
- Works seamlessly with Next.js App Router
- Built-in loading states and optimistic updates
- Minimal boilerplate compared to Redux or Zustand
- Perfect for read-heavy applications like catalog exploration

**Alternatives considered**:
- React Query: Similar features but SWR has simpler API
- Redux Toolkit: Overkill for read-only data
- Apollo Client: Unnecessary complexity for REST API

### UI Framework & Styling
**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library  
**Rationale**:
- Tailwind provides utility-first styling with excellent performance
- shadcn/ui offers high-quality, accessible components
- Perfect integration with Next.js and TypeScript
- Customizable design system
- Excellent developer experience with IntelliSense

**Alternatives considered**:
- Material-UI: More opinionated design system
- Chakra UI: Good but shadcn/ui has better TypeScript support
- Styled Components: Runtime overhead, less performant

### Code Editor Integration
**Decision**: Use Monaco Editor for code snippets  
**Rationale**:
- Same editor engine as VS Code
- Excellent syntax highlighting for multiple languages
- Built-in IntelliSense and code completion
- Read-only mode perfect for displaying examples
- Strong TypeScript and C# support

**Alternatives considered**:
- CodeMirror: Good but Monaco has better language support
- Prism.js: Syntax highlighting only, no editor features
- Ace Editor: Older, less maintained

### Graph Visualization
**Decision**: Use Cytoscape.js for interactive graph visualization  
**Rationale**:
- Excellent performance for large graphs (up to 10,000 nodes)
- Rich interaction features (zoom, pan, selection)
- Flexible layout algorithms
- Good TypeScript support
- Active development and community

**Alternatives considered**:
- D3.js: More flexible but requires more custom code
- vis.js: Good but less performant for large graphs
- React Flow: Good for flowcharts but less suitable for force graphs

## Performance Research

### Search Performance Optimization
**Decision**: Implement client-side search with debouncing and caching  
**Rationale**:
- 300ms P50 requirement achievable with client-side search
- SWR provides automatic caching and background revalidation
- Debouncing prevents excessive API calls
- Pagination handles large result sets efficiently

**Implementation approach**:
- Debounced search input (300ms delay)
- SWR cache with 5-minute stale-while-revalidate
- Pagination with virtual scrolling for large results
- Optimistic UI updates

### Page Load Performance
**Decision**: Use Next.js App Router with Server Components and streaming  
**Rationale**:
- Server Components reduce client-side JavaScript
- Streaming enables progressive page loading
- Built-in image optimization and code splitting
- 400ms P50 requirement achievable with proper caching

**Implementation approach**:
- Server Components for initial page loads
- Client Components only for interactive features
- SWR for client-side data fetching and caching
- Skeleton loaders for perceived performance

## Integration Research

### F002 Catalog API Integration
**Decision**: Create typed API client with error handling and retry logic  
**Rationale**:
- Type safety prevents runtime errors
- Centralized error handling with toast notifications
- Retry logic for network failures
- Consistent API interface across components

**Implementation approach**:
- Generated TypeScript types from API schema
- Axios or fetch with retry logic
- Error boundaries for graceful failure handling
- Toast notifications for user feedback

### Deep Linking Strategy
**Decision**: Use provenance data from API to construct Git URLs  
**Rationale**:
- API provides repository, file path, and line number data
- Construct URLs using standard Git hosting patterns
- Fallback to repository root when specific links unavailable
- Support for multiple Git hosting providers

**Implementation approach**:
- Parse provenance data from API responses
- Template-based URL construction
- Provider detection (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Fallback handling for missing data

## Accessibility Research

### Keyboard Navigation
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation with focus management  
**Rationale**:
- Essential for developer productivity
- Required for accessibility compliance
- Command-K palette for quick access
- Tab navigation through all interactive elements

**Implementation approach**:
- Custom keyboard hook for global shortcuts
- Focus trap in modals and overlays
- Skip links for screen readers
- ARIA labels and roles

### Screen Reader Support
**Decision**: Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes  
**Rationale**:
- shadcn/ui components include accessibility features
- Semantic HTML provides better screen reader experience
- ARIA attributes for complex interactions
- Focus indicators for keyboard users

## Testing Strategy Research

### Component Testing
**Decision**: Use Vitest with React Testing Library  
**Rationale**:
- Faster than Jest with better TypeScript support
- RTL encourages accessible component design
- Excellent mocking capabilities
- Good integration with Next.js

### End-to-End Testing
**Decision**: Use Playwright for critical user flows  
**Rationale**:
- Cross-browser testing support
- Excellent debugging tools
- Fast execution and reliable tests
- Good TypeScript support

### Performance Testing
**Decision**: Use Lighthouse CI for performance budgets  
**Rationale**:
- Automated performance monitoring
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- Clear performance budgets

## Security Research

### Open Access Model
**Decision**: No authentication required for the application  
**Rationale**:
- Clarified in requirements as open access
- No sensitive data stored in frontend
- All data sourced from read-only API
- Reduces complexity and improves developer experience

**Security considerations**:
- No user input validation needed (read-only)
- API handles all data access controls
- No client-side secrets or tokens
- HTTPS required for production deployment

## Deployment Research

### Containerization
**Decision**: Use Docker with multi-stage builds  
**Rationale**:
- Consistent deployment across environments
- Optimized production builds
- Easy scaling and orchestration
- Integration with existing infrastructure

**Implementation approach**:
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimization
- Node.js Alpine base image
- Static asset optimization
- Health check endpoints

### Environment Configuration
**Decision**: Use environment variables for API configuration  
**Rationale**:
- Secure configuration management
- Easy deployment across environments
- No hardcoded URLs or secrets
- Standard Next.js configuration pattern

## Research Summary

All technology decisions align with the constitution requirements and feature specifications. The chosen stack provides excellent performance, developer experience, and maintainability while meeting all functional and non-functional requirements. No critical unknowns remain that would block implementation.
