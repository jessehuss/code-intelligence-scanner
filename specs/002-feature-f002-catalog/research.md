# Research: F002 – Catalog API

**Feature**: F002 – Catalog API  
**Date**: 2025-01-02  
**Status**: Complete  

## Research Decisions

### Atlas Search Integration for .NET 8

**Decision**: Use MongoDB Atlas Search with aggregation pipelines for search functionality  
**Rationale**: Atlas Search provides built-in full-text search, autocomplete, and fuzzy matching capabilities that are optimized for MongoDB data. The aggregation pipeline approach allows for complex search queries with filtering, sorting, and faceting.  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Elasticsearch: More complex setup and maintenance
- MongoDB text indexes: Limited functionality compared to Atlas Search
- Custom search implementation: Would require significant development effort

### Redis Caching for ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs

**Decision**: Implement Redis-based caching with configurable TTL policies using StackExchange.Redis  
**Rationale**: Redis provides high-performance distributed caching with TTL support, which is essential for meeting the <300ms P50 response time requirements. StackExchange.Redis is the most mature and performant Redis client for .NET.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- In-memory caching: Not suitable for distributed scenarios
- SQL Server caching: Lower performance than Redis
- No caching: Would not meet performance requirements

### MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines for Graph Traversal

**Decision**: Use MongoDB aggregation pipelines with $graphLookup for graph traversal operations  
**Rationale**: $graphLookup provides efficient graph traversal capabilities within MongoDB, eliminating the need for a separate graph database. This approach maintains data consistency and reduces complexity.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Neo4j: Additional infrastructure and complexity
- Custom graph traversal: Would require significant development effort
- Pre-computed adjacency lists: Higher storage requirements and update complexity

### Performance Optimization for Search Endpoints

**Decision**: Implement multi-level optimization: Redis caching, MongoDB indexes, and query optimization  
**Rationale**: Multiple optimization layers ensure consistent performance under varying load conditions. Redis caching handles frequently accessed data, MongoDB indexes optimize database queries, and query optimization reduces processing time.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Single optimization approach: Insufficient for performance requirements
- Database-only optimization: Would not meet caching requirements
- Application-only optimization: Would not optimize database performance

### Error Handling Patterns for REST APIs

**Decision**: Implement structured error responses using Problem Details (RFC 7807) with custom error codes  
**Rationale**: Problem Details provides a standardized format for error responses that is machine-readable and user-friendly. Custom error codes allow for specific error handling in client applications.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple error messages: Not standardized and harder to handle programmatically
- HTTP status codes only: Insufficient detail for complex error scenarios
- Custom error format: Would require additional documentation and client implementation

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### API Framework
**Decision**: ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs  
**Rationale**: Minimal APIs provide a lightweight, high-performance approach for building APIs with reduced boilerplate code. This aligns with the constitutional requirement for ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs.

### Data Access Pattern
**Decision**: Repository pattern with MongoDB.Driver  
**Rationale**: Repository pattern provides abstraction over data access, making testing easier and maintaining consistency with the constitutional requirement for MongoDB.Driver.

### Caching Strategy
**Decision**: Multi-level caching with Redis as primary cache and in-memory as fallback  
**Rationale**: Ensures high availability and performance even if Redis is temporarily unavailable.

### Observability
**Decision**: Structured logging with Serilog, metrics with Prometheus, and distributed tracing  
**Rationale**: Provides comprehensive observability as required by the constitutional principles and functional requirements.

## Performance Considerations

### Search Performance
- Atlas Search indexes will be optimized for common search patterns
- Redis caching will store frequently accessed search results
- Query optimization will focus on reducing MongoDB aggregation pipeline complexity

### Graph Traversal Performance
- $graphLookup operations will be limited by depth constraints
- Graph queries will be cached in Redis to avoid repeated expensive operations
- Indexes will be created on graph edge collections

### Caching Performance
- TTL policies will be configured based on data volatility
- Cache invalidation strategies will be implemented for data updates
- Redis connection pooling will be optimized for high throughput

## Security Considerations

### Data Access
- Read-only access to knowledge base (constitutional requirement)
- No authentication required (internal use only)
- All API calls will be logged for audit purposes

### Error Information
- Error responses will not expose sensitive system information
- Stack traces will be logged but not returned to clients
- Custom error codes will provide sufficient detail without security risks

## Integration Points

### MongoDB Knowledge Base
- Direct connection to existing catalog_kb database
- Read-only operations only
- Leverage existing data structures and indexes

### Atlas Search
- Integration with existing search indexes
- Configuration through MongoDB connection string
- Search queries will use aggregation pipelines

### Redis Cache
- Separate Redis instance for caching
- Configuration through environment variables
- Fallback to in-memory caching if Redis unavailable

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Request/response logging for all endpoints
- Performance metrics logging

### Metrics
- Response time metrics for all endpoints
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- MongoDB query performance metrics
- Error rate tracking

### Health Checks
- MongoDB connection health
- Redis connection health
- Atlas Search availability
- Overall API health status

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Handler testing with mocked services
- Service testing with in-memory implementations
- Model validation testing

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end API testing with test containers
- MongoDB integration testing
- Redis integration testing

### Contract Testing
- API contract validation
- Response schema validation
- Error response validation

### Performance Testing
- Load testing for performance requirements
- Stress testing for scalability
- Cache performance testing

## Deployment Considerations

### Containerization
- Docker container with .NET 8 runtime
- Multi-stage build for optimization
- Health check endpoints

### Configuration
- Environment-based configuration
- Secrets management for connection strings
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts

### Scaling
- Horizontal scaling support
- Load balancer compatibility
- Stateless design for scalability

## Future Considerations

### Authentication
- Bearer token support for future SSO integration
- API key support for external integrations
- Rate limiting for public endpoints

### Graph Database
- Optional Neo4j integration for complex graph queries
- GraphQL endpoint for graph-specific operations
- Advanced graph algorithms support
